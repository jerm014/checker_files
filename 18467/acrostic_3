For all the joys and all the grief
Of shared love from a time ago
Reaching deep into your amber 
Eyes still filled with you sparkle
Vying for that young, zesty rev
Even, as your Muscles do wane
Resting on your laurels,  Never

In you have I become a new i
Nourished, by all you’ve sown

You’ve colored richly our tapestry
On waves strung highest soprano 
Undulating uniquely~me and you
Resplendence in our duet’s quiver

Ever more a part of my psyche
Your spirit, will be my memory
Entwined always, this embrace
Surely, our souls’ best oneness
